1. How long did you spend on the technical test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the technical test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add. 
 I have spent close to 8 hours on the test.
 If I had more time, I would have made the test solution more robust. The ads that appear randomly on different pages are difficult to navigate/handle. It requires more research to handle the ads effectively and make tests less brittle.

2. What do you think is the most interesting trend in test automation? 
More applications are adopting Node/React front-end development and using tools such as WebdriverIO and Cypress for testing are becoming increasingly popular. Also more focus on backend testing, as it more stable interface and quicker results.
